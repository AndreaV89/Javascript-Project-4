Browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter".

The game choose a random phrase from an array of 5 phrases, split the phrase into letters and show the letters in the gameboard.
The player can choose letters from the keyboard and if the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. 

The player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).
A letter can be chosen only once. The chosen letter will be disabled from the keyboard.

Style change:
- changed color to correct letters on the keyboard to green and animation added;
- changed color to wrong letters on the keyboard to red and shake animation added:
- changed color to displayed letters on the gameboard and animation added.
